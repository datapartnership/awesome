The collection of islands is home to different concentrations of ethnic, cultural, linguistic, and socioeconomic groups, with an imbalanced distribution of health facilities and physicians.Through conversations with experts on the ground, we understood that health facility records are largely incomplete and on paper. By using a combination of public and private sector data, we aimed for a more comprehensive understanding of health facility accessibility. mobility: an R package for modeling human mobility patterns by @gilesjohnr and Amy Wesolowski This GitHub repository contains source code to build the mobility R package which provides tools for analyzing human mobility data, including functions for parsing travel data, fitting mobility models using Bayesian inference, and simulating mobility patterns. This package is currently in development and maintained by John Giles (@gilesjohnr) and Amy Wesolowski. Risk Dashboard development coordination by @worldbank This repo coordinates and documents Health, DECAT, and consulting firms support to COVID fact track response projects. It consolidates and aligns contributions from a number of internal and external contributors.
